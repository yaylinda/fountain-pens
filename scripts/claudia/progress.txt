## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00001 - Docker configuration for git support

### Summary
Added git package installation to Dockerfile and configured docker-compose.yml to mount .git directory with proper git user configuration via environment variables.

### Files Changed
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml

### Learnings
- Git 2.35.2+ requires safe.directory configuration when repo ownership differs from user - added global config in Dockerfile
- Git author/committer can be configured via GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL env vars

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00002 - Backend API endpoint: GET /api/git/diff

### Summary
Implemented GET /api/git/diff endpoint that returns JSON with diff output and hasChanges boolean for data files.

### Files Changed
- server.js

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00003 - Backend API endpoint: POST /api/git/push

### Summary
Implemented POST /api/git/push endpoint that stages data files, commits with human-readable timestamp, and pushes to origin main. Returns success/error status with stdout/stderr.

### Files Changed
- server.js

### Learnings
- Used child_process exec with promisify for async git operations
- Error handling captures stdout/stderr from failed git commands for debugging

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00004 - DirtyStateContext for tracking unsaved changes

### Summary
Created React Context for global dirty state tracking, wrapped around app in main.tsx. Provides isDirty boolean and setDirty function.

### Files Changed
- src/context/DirtyStateContext.tsx (new)
- src/main.tsx

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00005 - Integrate dirty state with data mutations

### Summary
Connected dataService mutations to DirtyStateContext via callback mechanism. All CRUD operations on inks, pens, and refill logs now trigger dirty state.

### Files Changed
- src/services/dataService.ts
- src/context/DirtyStateContext.tsx

### Learnings
- Used callback pattern to bridge module-level dataService with React context (avoids circular imports and keeps dataService framework-agnostic)

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00006 - SaveButton component in AppBar header

### Summary
Verified SaveButton component implementation that renders in AppBar with CloudUpload icon. Button correctly responds to isDirty state (disabled when clean, enabled when dirty) and opens SaveDialog when clicked.

### Files Changed
- src/components/SaveButton.tsx (new)
- src/App.tsx

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00007 - SaveDialog component with diff preview

### Summary
Verified SaveDialog component with full diff preview functionality. Fetches diff from API on open, displays changes with color-coded additions (green) and deletions (red), and provides Cancel and 'Confirm & Push' buttons.

### Files Changed
- src/components/SaveDialog.tsx (new)
- src/App.tsx

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00008 - Push process with loading state and error handling

### Summary
Verified push process implementation with CircularProgress spinner showing 'Pushing to GitHub...' text, disabled buttons during push, scrollable error display on failure with retry capability, and automatic dialog close with dirty state reset on success.

### Files Changed
- src/components/SaveDialog.tsx

---

## 2026-01-30: fountain-pens-00009 - Success celebration with confetti and snackbar

### Summary
Verified confetti animation (canvas-confetti library) and MUI Snackbar success message. On successful push, confetti plays with moderate particle count (100) and spread (70), while snackbar displays 'Changes pushed to GitHub successfully!' for 4 seconds.

### Files Changed
- package.json (canvas-confetti dependency)
- src/App.tsx
